# Options_Strategy

EXTREMELY BASIC INSTRUCTIONS=
1) git clone this repository into a new folder for this project :::   
 git clone https://github.com/creeder9/Options_Strategy.git
2) install requirements   :::   
pip install node_modules
3) start the server   :::   
npm run
4) Open the index.html file   :::   
(literally just click it)

IMMEDIATE FIXES
1) When posting a strategy, the premade strategies dissappear
2) Create a profile for strategy posters
3) Progress bar to show how close the strategy is to reaching its funding goal
4) Create actual strategies with pictures to depict them to include in the premade strategies
5) Have the "additional information" when clicking strategy appear directly below it, rather than having the same location for all of them.
   
FUTURE DIRECTION
1) Use Solidity to write Ethereum smart contracts.
   - Write the smart contract code for crowdfunding, ensuring all necessary features and security measures are included(handle pledges, manage funds, deposit returns,execute options).
2) Set Up Ganache:
   - Deploy your smart contract to their local blockchain for testing.
3) Integrate MetaMask:
   - Develop the front-end to interact with MetaMask, using Web3.js to handle blockchain interactions.
   - Configure application to connect to Ganache's local blockchain through MetaMask for testing.
4) Server Integration:
   - (possibly) Develop a backend server that will handle non-blockchain logic of the platform.
   - Make sure that server can communicate with front-end and the blockchain (via the smart contract).
5) Implement security measures to protect user data and transactions.
6) Ensure that users can easily understand how to pledge funds and interact with the options strategies.
